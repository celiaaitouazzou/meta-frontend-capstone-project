Little Lemon
Chicago
Tucked into the city’s edge with a breeze of coastal charm, Little Lemon is the brainchild of Italian brothers Adrian and Mario — a modern Mediterranean spot where old-world flavors meet effortlessly cool vibes.
Think bright citrus, bold herbs, wood-fired everything, and a wine list that knows how to party.
It’s casual, it’s intimate, it’s where the playlist hits just right and the plates are made to be shared.
Come for the hummus, stay for the limoncello.
